After pulling make sure to create your virtual environment
with "python3 -m venv venv". This created a folder called venv.
Then run "source ./venv/bin/activate" to activate the environment in your terminal.
Finally, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the 
dependencies for the project.

Do not include any dataset files in the repo as they are too large and do not include your 
venv in the repo either.
